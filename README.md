# Gtil

Normally, we (developers) are using GitHub issues as a place to note everything that we learned in a day - TIL (Today I Learn).

And I'm also a fan of terminal, I want to note TIL from my terminal, and push to my GH TIL repository. That's why I build this CLI application.

*Detail will be update soon*
